# (repo)st

`(repo)st`: A ü§ñ &nbsp;for posting new GitHub discussions using pull requests üì¨

1Ô∏è‚É£ &nbsp;Create a pull request to get feedback from your teammates on your discussion post\
2Ô∏è‚É£ &nbsp;Merge the pull request and the discussion automatically gets created in whatever repository or team you want!

![Demo](docs/assets/repost-demo.gif)

## Quickstart Guide

1. [Install the GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/repo-st) and authorize for any repositories or teams you would like it to be able to post to or watch for markdown posts.
2. Add a `.github/announcement-drafter.yml` (not `.yaml`) configuration file to any repositories you want the bot to watch. [Look here for an example in the demo repo][repost demo config]

   1. Provide what folders you want the `(repo)st` bot to watch and (optionally) what folders you would like it to ignore when new pull requests are open

   ```yml
   watch_folders:
     - docs/
   ignore_folders:
     - docs/demo/ignore
   ```

3. Now whenever you create a pull request with discussion markdown in those watch folders, `(repo)st` will ask for approvals to create discussions, and when the pull request is merged, it will create the discussions and post as the author!
4. See [Usage](#usage) for more specific usage instructions

## Usage

### Prerequisites

1. Follow the [Quickstart guide](#quickstart-guide) for information on getting started
2. If there is no `.github/announcement-drafter.yml` file in your repository, `(repo)st` will not do anything
3. To use images, videos, gifs etc., do not use relative links to a file in your repo. Instead drag/drop or paste the file into the markdown. The link generated should be to `https://user-images.githubusercontent.com`

### App Configuration Options

These options should go in your repository's `.github/announcement-drafter.yml` file.

| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `watch_folders`  | A list of what folders (relative paths) `(repo)st` should watch when new pull requests are open<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. It is recommened to include the final `/` in the path<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. `(repo)st` will also watch all subfolders unless you ignore them in `ignore_folders` | Yes      | [See demo config][repost demo config] |
| `ignore_folders` | A list of what folders (relative paths) `(repo)st` should _ignore_ when new pull requests are open                                                                                                                                                                               | No       | [See demo config][repost demo config] |

### Discussion Markdown

`(repo)st` needs to know certain information such as what repository or team to create the discussion in, and what the discussion category should be. This information should be provided in YAML metadata at the top of your markdown file.

#### Example

Example from [demo repository](https://github.com/philip-gai/repost-demo/blob/main/docs/demo/hello-world.md?plain=1):

```markdown
<!--
author: philip-gai
repository: https://github.com/philip-gai/repost-demo
category: announcements
-->

# Hello World! üëã

Hello beautiful world! üåé
```

### Workflow for reviewing and posting a new discussion

1. Write your discussion post with with `(repo)st` [discussion markdown](#discussion-markdown)
2. Create a pull request
3. `(repo)st` will comment on the discussion markdown file asking for approval from the author to post the discussions. It will also notify you of any validation erros.
   1. An approval requires the author to react (not reply) to the comment with a üöÄ
   2. If there are errors, fix them and recreate a new pull request so `(repo)st` can revalidate (Will fix this - see issue [#36](https://github.com/philip-gai/repost/issues/36))
4. Receive feedback from your teammates
5. Make updates
   1. These will not be revalidated by the bot unless you recreate the pull request. See [#36](https://github.com/philip-gai/repost/issues/36)
6. Approve all the discussions you would like posted by reacting (not replying) with a üöÄ
7. If `(repo)st` bot asks, make sure to authenticate so it can post as the author and not as itself
8. Merge the pull request
9. `(repo)st` will create the discussion and reply to the comment with a link to the newly creating discussion
   1. If there were issues it will include them in the reply
